# concurrency
repo for concurrency practicals development: there are 4 different folders, 3 for current practicals & the other for older practicals

### p1 concurrent array
implementation of a program in which several threads share an integer array, initialized to 0s
each thread should iterate a given number of times, increasing a random position in the array by 1
- e1: create threads & protect the array
- e2: protect each value on the array individually
- e3: add threads that swap values on two different positions
- e4: change the behaviour of the iterations so that it specifies the number of total iterations for each set of threads

### previous-practicals
another set of 3 practicals, for more details check its own readme
